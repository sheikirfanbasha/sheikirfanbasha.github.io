Augmented Reality(AR) is a concept of overlaying computer generated virutal information in the real world. All of us are experiencing it everyday, for example the TV that is mounted to your wall (real object), showing the computer generated video/movie(virtual info), the Phone (real object) that your hold in your hand showing the weather information(virtual info). Though these examples don't come under true AR, they give a better understanding of the concept.

The most widely accepted definition of true AR is given by Azum[1997], and it is defined as follows:

True AR system shall have the following characteristics:

- Merge real world with virutal information
- Should have a continous feedback and interaction
- The real world should have registered/calibrated in 3D

The following are some of the examples of true AR:
