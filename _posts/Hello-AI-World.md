# The Ultimate Dream

It can be strongly believed that the whole universe is dreams driven. We witness it on earth everyday. Everybody in our world is either living their own dream or somebody else dream. But the ultimate dream shared to all of us is to demolish the whole human race and life on earth. Don’t know if this is the dream of God or someone else but we humans are executing it perfectly without realization. It is a complete mind game being played to create one big monolithic evil which will have the power to demolish the life on earth completely.

# How it all starts?

It all starts with one simple question. “What you want to do with your life?” The answer is mostly influenced by accomplished dreams that already exist. Like, inspirational fictional characters or real roles.
The answer can vary in a variety of ranges:
For a kid. He would want be a spider man, super man, etc.,
For an average person. He/She would want to be an engineer, doctor, creator of robots that will help mankind etc.,
For an avergae adult. He/She would want to be a good father, etc.,
For a matured adult. He/She would want to do something for the society etc.,
For an old person. He/She would want to live the rest of the life with peace and love etc.,

Among the above answers few are movies driven, few are money driven, few are society driven and few are our traditional culture driven. But one thing remains common in all the above answers. It is the “Change”.
“Change is the only thing that can remain constant”
Demolition in progress
The hunger for change in everyones life is the major threat for the future. We already are witnessing these threats. But none of us are realizing to an extent to consider it serious:
The industrial revolution: Caused Urbanization. Made people more money driven. People in villages moved to cities and People in cities moved abroad — Increased the threat of Global warming, Caste feelings, Regional feelings, National feelings, threat of war — Opened new era of reasons for killing of human by another human. Created weapons capable of killing thousands of people at a time. Created vehicles to increase all sorts of pollution
The technology revolution: This is epic. It already took away the importance of personal touch from our lives. Now a days no one want to come meet the family in person. They just keep fooling themselves by talking over skype or other softwares thinking they are being in personal touch. Completely shifting the real feeling of love, mercy, care and affection towards person to the machine. Example mobiles have become part of everyones life taking away complete control of sharing all human love towards it.
The Big Data Revolution: This is the hot in the market and fantastic change which can bring down the time that would take for human race extinction from thousands of years to tens of years. Phase of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. The whole data about each individual is put in the hands of big monolithic evil (“VIKI” as pointed in I Robot movie), which will take complete control on mankind’s existence.

# Conclusion

Having this understanding it is crucial that each one of us realize these truths and stop creating all the things like robots, driver less cars, artificial intelligent systems. And stop supporting/using our private data sharing applications like google, facebook, amazon etc., And stop adopting ourself to newer technologies and make ourself lazy, curious less, dumb creatures.
But none of the people will be in a position to listen and accept it because technology has become part of their lives and hunger for change is over dominated on their minds. Lives have become more money driven rather than humanity driven.
The only way we can make this realization happen is to join our hands to build that monolithic evil system as early as possible and make people feel the disaster that it can create at the earliest.
